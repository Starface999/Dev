            <p>An interesting landscape test-project is currently underway in Milwaukee, called the "BaseTern" program. As the city explains it, a "BaseTern" is "an underground stormwater management or rainwater harvesting structure created from the former basement of an abandoned home that has been slated for demolition." Why is the city doing this? "By using abandoned basements, the City saves the cost of demolition on these structures (filing the basement and grading the surface) and on excavation for the new structure. In addition, BaseTerns provide significant stormwater storage capacity on a single site, the equivalent of up to 600 rain barrels."</p>

            <p>The result, the city is keen to add, is "not an open pit. Rather a BaseTern is a covered structure, which is covered with topsoil and grass, and will appear the same as conventional vacant lot." In their July 2015 issue, Landscape Architecture Magazine explained that this is, in fact, "the world’s first such system." Conceived—and actually trademarked—by a city official named Erick Shambarger, the idea was inspired by a GIS-fueled discovery that the worst flooding in the city always "occurred in neighborhoods with high rates of foreclosures. The city controls roughly 900 foreclosed properties, many of which it plans to demolish. Shambarger figured the city could preserve the basement structure and put it to use."</p>
